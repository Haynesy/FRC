Swing Rendering Fundamentals
    Events
        Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) java.awt.EventQueue

    Painting
        Add Paint request
        Call paint() or paintComponent() on the EDT

        Repaint Categories
            Asynchronous
                Component.repaint()
                    -Will repaint the entire component by
                        adding a request to the queue.
                    - Will cause any child components to
                        repaint as well.
                    - Is equivalent to calling
                        Component.repaint(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight())

                Component.repaint(int x, int y, int width, int height)
                    - Will repaint a specific rectangle
                        in the component.

            Synchronous
                JComponent.paintImmediately(int x, int y, int w, int h)
                JComponent.paintImmediately(Rectangle r)
                    - You need to be on the EDT.
                    - Can cause undefined behaviour.
                    - Will call paint() immediately.

                Component.paint(Graphics g)
                    - Not generally used.
                    - Useful for some Animation techniques

    Rendering
        1. Paint request is placed onto the event queue.
        2. Event is dispatched to the Swing RepaintManager.
        3. RepaintManager calls paint() on the appropriate component.
        4. Component paints its own content then its border and then
            any child components.
        public void paint(Graphics g){
            paintComponent();
            paintBorder();
            paintChildren();
        }

        Areas of concern for creating an application
            - JComponent.paintComponent(Graphics g) may be overridden to
                implement custom behaviour.
            - Component.paint(Graphics g) may be overridden to set up
                specific graphics states.
            - JComponent.setOpaque(boolean) may need to be called with
                param false depending on whether the components rectangular
                bounds are completely opaque. This will force non opaque
                components to render correctly.

    Double-Buffering
        Swing is double buffered by default.
        setOpaque(true)
            - Component does not have any alpha components.
        setOpaque(false)
            - Component has alpha components and the background will need
                to be drawn first.

    Threading
        Swing always creates 3 threads.
            - The main thread. Runs your main function.
            - The toolkit thread. Captures system events and passes them to the EDT.
            - The Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)
